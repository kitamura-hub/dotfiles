- Shell : Zsh

<br />

## Installation

<p>ðŸ”¥Right now, I working on improving it so that it can be installed more easily.ðŸ”¥</p>
<p><strong>âš ï¸Ž[5.]When executing 5</strong>, if a file or folder with the same name exists at the link destination, the shell may not work properly.</p>
<p><strong>If it exists</strong>, back it up to another location and save it, or delete it.</p>

```
1. cd ~
2. git clone https://github.com/kitamura-hub/dotfiles.git
3. cd dotfiles
4. chmod +x link.sh
5. sh link.sh

â€»VScode
6. chmod +x vscode_link.sh
7. sh vscode_link.sh
```

## Thanks

<p>Thank you for taking a look at my dotfiles. I am still immature as a dotfiler. However, I will acquire a lot of knowledge and update to a better dot file from now on.</p>
